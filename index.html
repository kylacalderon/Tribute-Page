      Becoming deaf and blind at the age of 2, Helen Keller did not let her disabilities hinder her from living life to the fullest. She instead adapted to her new way of living, and became an activist for others like herself. She set out to give hope to those who shared similar struggles by speaking about her experiences with audiences all over the world. She was the embodiment of hope to the hopeless and her perseverance continue to inspire people today.

      Harriet Tubman was a pioneer for freedom. Born into slavery in the 1800s she escaped, but her heart was for her people and worth risking her own freedom. She is the most famous for building the Underground Railroad: A passage for the enslaved into freedom. 
      
      "I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say â€“ I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."

      Jane Austen is considered one of the greatest writers in English history. She was a woman that wrote about things no other woman dared to write about. She was full of passion, drive, and she broke through the stereotype of who a woman was back in the 17th century. Her books are widely renowned around the world and became famous after her death.
